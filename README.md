This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).


# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Run Emulator

Have your emulator running (Andriod Studio)
You can run "emulator -list-avds" in terminal to see if your emulator is running. If it comes back empty, 
something is wrong.

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With the emulator running, open terminal and use one of the following commands to build and run Android app

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

Common Issues:
Make sure in gradle/local.properties has your sdk and ndk path (can find that on Andriod Studio)
In app/build.gradle make sure your ndk version(under andrioid) is the right one (you can check by going AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk and seeing the file names)

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
